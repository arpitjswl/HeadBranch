Code 

1 --> Find all anagrams in a Arrays of String. 
	i/p {"cat", "dog", "tac", "god", "act"}
	 expected o/p [cat, tac, act], [dog, god]

2 --> Find first non-repeating character in a String.

3 --> Given a Sum, Return two indices of Integer array it should be (a + b) SUM

4 --> Given two String find if they are anagram of each other.

5 --> Given array of Integers shift all zeroes to beginning of array.

6 --> How do you print duplicate characters from String.

7 --> How do you check if two Strings are a rotation of each other.
  
8 --> How to remove duplicates in String.

9 --> Check if an array of Integers contains duplicate if contains return true else return false, if all the array elements contains unique then only return true
	i/p --> {1, 2, 1, 7} --> returns true 
	i/p --> {6, 1, 3, 9} --> return  false	
	
10 --> Given an array of Integers, its basically represents stock price from Day 0 to Day N {7, 2, 1, 67, 98, 12}, so return an Integer which
	 will give maximum profit when an stock is purchased on A particular day and and sell on the other day, 98 -1 = 97 which is max profit in example.
